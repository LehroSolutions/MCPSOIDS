## Purpose

Describe the end-to-end workflows that the public product currently supports.

## On this page

- [Primary workflows](#primary-workflows)
- [Recovery behavior](#recovery-behavior)
- [Verification](#verification)

## Primary workflows

1. Use the control center to inspect health, audits, capabilities, and a live tool call.
2. Use the Roots laboratory to verify traversal rejection before enabling filesystem capabilities.

## Recovery behavior

Show actionable errors, preserve safe user input where possible, and explain the next recovery action. For destructive or irreversible actions, require confirmation and document the available undo or export path.

## Verification

- Exercise a happy path, an empty state, a validation error, and a recovery path.
- Confirm instructions match visible labels and current API/UI behavior.
