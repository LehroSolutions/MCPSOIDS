## Current safeguards

- Configure authentication, allowed origins, policy mode, and audit paths before exposing HTTP transport.
- Keep filesystem access disabled unless the operator explicitly enables and constrains it.

## Contributor rules

- Never commit real credentials, populated runtime data, access tokens, or private production logs.
- Validate untrusted input at the API or import boundary.
- Document security-relevant decisions in an ADR or evidence log when trade-offs are durable.

## Verification

- Run targeted negative-path tests where the product provides them.
- Confirm public examples use synthetic data and safe defaults.
